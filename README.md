Hello! This is the source code for my personal portfolio website. It's designed to feel like a cozy **NookPhone App** or a digital diary, featuring a chatty AI assistant, and a showcase of my projects.

Built with love, code, and a sweaty.

## 🎒 What's Inside? (Features)

* **📂 Project Museum:** A masonry-style gallery showcasing my works (Web, Mobile, Data Engineering).
* **🌗 Day & Night Cycle:** Toggle between "Warm Morning" ☀️ and "Cozy Night" 🌙 themes (Dark/Light mode).
* **🔊 Interactive SFX:** Satisfying click and hover sounds (ASMR for devs!).
* **📱 Responsive Design:** A greedy looks like a nook-phone app frome animal crossing, actually can check it now.
